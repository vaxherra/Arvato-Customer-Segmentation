# Project proposal: Customer Segmentation Report for Arvato Financial Services

> *Robert Kwapich, June 2020*

## Domain Background
Project focuses on the customer segmentation, an analysis of demographic data of customers of a Arvato company. 

Arvato is a mail order sales company in Germany (also in other countries) that wants to leverage information about the general population in Germany to identify parts of this population that are most likely to use or be persuaded to use their services.

Moreover, the company has gathered historical data from the past marketing campaigns that recorded demographic info, as well as information about success or failure in convincing a person to become Arvato's customer. 

Arvato kindly provided anonymized data on their customers, the results of the marketing campaign and the general population demographics of Germany (see **Datasets and Inputs** below for details)


## Problem Statement

The project consists of serval steps:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data preparation**

    Provided data should be explored, standardized, cleaned and pre-processed in a way that would enable subsequent unsupervised and supervised analysis possible: providing information about possible models.

    The extent to which missing data are present should be analyzed, and appropriate steps should be taken: removal or imputation.


2. **Customer data segmentation**

    Quantify and describe the relationship between the demographics of Arvato's customers and general population of Germany. 

    The goal is to extract valuable information about general population of Germany, and identify segments that are more likely to become part of Arvato client base. 
    
    This data could be then used for targeted marketing campaigns that could present Arvato offer to the people that are most likely to use it. 

3. **Customer aquisition prediction**

    Utilizing previously explored customer demographic data, with Arvato's marketing campaign results, it is possible to create and deploy a supervised model for classification. This model will provide a classification of whether a customer will likely or won't become a Arvato's client in the future.

    Serveral different model architectures will be used, each of which will be tuned with respect to the optimal hyperparameters. 

4. **Kaggle competition / Model Validation**

    Provided **test** dataset purposefully doesn't contain the prediction labels, so as to objectively validate the final model performance for all participants in the **Kaggle** data science competition: [link here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/udacity-arvato-identify-customers).

    The objective here is to submit the prediction results for the best obtained model, and obtain the final AUC score.
